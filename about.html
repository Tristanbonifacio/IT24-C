               <h2 style="color:rgb(52, 52, 151)">Nifuji hirotaka</h2>
               <h3 style="color:rgb(52, 52, 152)">Hirotaka is known for his calm and collected demeanor, which often makes him appear aloof and unapproachable.
                
               <h3 style="color:rgb(66, 25, 149)"> Due to many years of gaming experience, he is very proficient in gaming. His love for games is intense, at one point even going as far to say to Narumi that without games, he'd die. His favorite genre of games is FPS, fighting, and action games.</h3>
